## **Title: Beyond the Chatbot: Designing the Human Systems for AI-Powered Health Innovation**

### **Introduction: The Vision and the Reality**

*This section sets the stage by contrasting the inspiring, forward-looking vision of "Superagency" with the current, chaotic reality of the "Pioneer's Dilemma," validating this tension as a shared experience for the audience.*

1. **The Vision of "Superagency":** Open with the inspiring vision of AI as an amplifier of human capability, creating a "cognitive dividend."  
2. **The "Pioneer's Dilemma":** Immediately contrast this vision with the personal story of the manuscript disclosure to illustrate the fear and risk of innovating without clear rules.  
3. **An Unspoken, Shared Experience:** Validate the personal story as a universal one using data from the pilots, showing that the fear of "getting in trouble" and confusion about "guardrails" is widespread.

### **Part 1: The Diagnosis \- The Friction Preventing Innovation**

*This section uses the "AI as a Mirror" metaphor to diagnose the root cause of our current challenges, framing "Foundational Chaos" not as a moral failing but as a systemic friction with a real, strategic cost to innovation and talent.*

1. **AI as a Mirror for Our Systems:** Introduce the central metaphor: AI reflects our processes, reveals our habits, and amplifies our chaos.  
2. **Identifying "Foundational Chaos":** Identify fragmented workflows and administrative friction as the primary barrier to innovation. Anchor this with the Michael Pencina quote.  
3. **The Strategic Cost of Friction:** Frame the primary cost as stifled "deep work" and the loss of top talent.  
4. **"Shadow AI" as a Signal for Unmet Needs:** Frame "Shadow AI" not as a problem to be punished, but as a clear signal from motivated people that the current systems are failing them.  
5. **Audience Engagement: The Live "Chaos Audit" Poll:**  
   * **Activity:** A live, anonymous poll (e.g., using Mentimeter) with three focused questions to make the "Foundational Chaos" tangible for the audience.  
   * **Question 1 (Processes):** "To what extent does your organization have standardized, documented processes that are used consistently across teams?" (Scale: 1-Not at all to 5-Completely)  
   * **Question 2 (Shadow AI):** "To what extent is 'Shadow AI' (the use of un-sanctioned AI tools) a significant activity in your organization?" (Scale: 1-Not at all to 5-Extremely significant)  
   * **Question 3 (Strategy):** "Does your organization have a coordinated, well-implemented AI strategy that is clearly communicated to you?" (Simple Yes/No)

### **Part 2: Paving the Cowpaths \- A Bootstrapper's Playbook for Transformation**

*This section pivots from diagnosis to solution, presenting a pragmatic, human-centric methodology for transformation. It provides both the "what" (Paving the Cowpaths) and the "how" (the Bootstrapper's Playbook) for building a new way of working from the ground up.*

1. **An Opportunity for a New Perspective:** Frame the solution from a workforce development perspective, highlighting the opportunity to strengthen the foundational 90% of the research lifecycle where innovation truly begins.  
2. **The "Pave the Cowpaths" Methodology (The WHAT):** Present the core, three-phase methodology (Manual Discovery, HITL Refinement, Scaled Automation) and the 2x2 Decision Framework as the actionable tool for leaders.  
3. **The "Bootstrapper's Playbook" (The HOW):** Detail the three-stage AI maturity journey (Foundational Skills → Systematic Practice → Scaled Automation) as the implementation guide being used in the pilots.  
4. **Audience Engagement: The Bootstrapper's Toolkit Website:**  
   * **Activity:** A QR code linking to a simple, elegant website or one-page infographic.  
   * **Content:** The site will provide a take-home summary of the "Bootstrapper's Playbook," offering simple, actionable examples for each of the three stages (e.g., a template for a personal "Master Prompt," an example of a reusable "Persona" file, a diagram showing how these can be used as blueprints for automation).

### **Part 3: The New Operating System in Action**

*This section describes the transformed organization that emerges from the playbook. It argues that a single foundational practice—Process Provenance—is the engine that builds the three core pillars of the new OS: Integrity, Talent, and Capability.*

1. **The Foundational Practice: Process Provenance:** Introduce the "Science Flight Recorder" as the one core practice required to build the new operating system.  
2. **Benefit 1: It Unlocks INTEGRITY (Makes Us Safe):** Explain that this practice provides a defensible position against accusations of misuse (addressing NIH policy) and ensures compliance with clinical regulations (addressing the ONC HTI-1 Final Rule).  
3. **Benefit 2: It Unlocks TALENT (Makes Us Better):** Argue that a transparent, documented process preserves the "inspiration edge" by valuing and protecting the uniquely human skills of "judgment, intuition, and creativity."  
4. **Benefit 3: It Unlocks CAPABILITY (Makes Us Smarter):** Frame the "Innovation Dividend" as the ultimate payoff. The documented process becomes a rich, analyzable dataset that allows us to systematically improve the science of team science (fulfilling the NCATS mission).  
5. **Audience Engagement: The Presentation's "Flight Recorder":**  
   * **Activity:** A QR code linking to a public GitHub repository.  
   * **Content:** This repository will serve as the "Process Provenance" for this very presentation. It will contain the image generation prompts, key architectural documents (like this narrative blueprint), and a README.md file that links to the NotebookLM project containing all the deep research sources. This is the ultimate "show, don't tell" moment.

### **Conclusion: From Cognitive Dividend to Moral Dividend**

*This section circles back to the opening vision, issuing a clear call to action and redefining the ultimate ROI of AI adoption from a story of productivity to an ethical narrative of human-centric value.*

1. **The Ultimate ROI:** The "cognitive dividend" from automation is reinvested to create a "Moral Dividend"—a measurable increase in human-centric work like empathy, stewardship, and profound connection.  
2. **Your First Step on Monday Morning:** Leave the audience with the pragmatic "Crawl, Walk, Run" model for phased adoption.  
3. **The Final Thought:** Close with the empowering call to action: "The future begins whenever someone stops prompting AI—and starts prompting themselves."
