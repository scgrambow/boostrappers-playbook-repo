# Process Provenance

This folder serves as the **science flight recorder** for the *Bootstrapper’s Playbook* project.  
It captures representative records of the creative, analytic, and design processes behind the presentation and its supporting artifacts.

Each file provides a structured snapshot — a concise record of how ideas became systems.  
This collection is **illustrative, not exhaustive**: the goal is to show the architecture of thinking, not to log every keystroke.

### 🧭 Purpose

**Process Provenance** makes the invisible visible.  
It transforms meetings, design sessions, and transcriptions into *evidence of thinking* — valuable artifacts for learning, replication, and trust-building.

Every structured record contributes to three goals:

- **Transparency:** Shows how decisions were made.  
- **Reproducibility:** Allows others to understand and retrace the reasoning process.  
- **Institutional Learning:** Turns unstructured collaboration (notes, transcripts, meeting summaries) into durable, analyzable knowledge.

When captured intentionally, these artifacts become part of a living system of organizational metacognition — a record of how knowledge evolves.

### 🧱 File Structure

Each provenance entry should include:

1. **Conceptual Summary** – What was the goal or challenge?  
2. **Principle-Based Linking** – Which design or reasoning principles guided the work?  
3. **Knowledge Capture** – Key insights, reflections, or emergent patterns.  
4. **Outcome or Action** – What decision or artifact resulted?  

Use this naming convention:  
`'YYYY-MM-DD_Descriptive_Title.md'`

Example:  
`'2025-10-06_Proposed_Visual_Arc.md'`
