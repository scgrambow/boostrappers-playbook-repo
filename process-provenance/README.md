# Process Provenance

This folder serves as the **science flight recorder** for *The Bootstrapper’s Playbook.*  
It captures a small, representative set of project sessions and intermediate artifacts that document how ideas evolved during the creation of the AI Summit presentation.

Each file here represents a **moment in the lineage of thought** — whether it was a structured session generated with the **Session Synthesizer**, or an intermediate working document created as part of the design and reasoning process.

### 🧭 Purpose

**Process Provenance** captures not only *what was built* but *how it came to be.*

It includes:
- **Session Synthesizer outputs** — structured provenance records combining machine-readable and human-readable elements.  
- **Intermediate artifacts** — narrative drafts, design sketches, and working documents that influenced or resulted from those sessions.  
- **Reflections** — files showing how human reasoning, context, and iterative refinement shaped the final outcome.

These artifacts together create a **transparent record of collaboration** between people and AI tools — showing the genealogy of ideas, their sponsorship by human authors, and the evolution of shared understanding over time.

### 🧩 About the Session Synthesizer

The **Session Synthesizer** is one of the core tools in the Playbook’s template library.  
It captures live sessions in a **dual-format structure**:
1. A **machine-readable XML ledger** (`<session_synthesis_report>`) — logs metadata, participants, key outputs, and idea lineage.  
2. A **human-readable process narrative** — documents how the collaboration unfolded, what decisions were made, and why.

Not every file in this folder was created by the Session Synthesizer, but all follow its *spirit*:  
**to preserve the reasoning, context, and creative dynamics of human-AI collaboration.**

| File | Description | Provenance Type |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| [`2025-10-05-Presentation Narrative Structure.md`](2025-10-05-Presentation%20Narrative%20Structure.md) | Defines the presentation’s conceptual and narrative backbone; produced as a collaborative planning document. | Intermediate Artifact |

| [`2025-10-06-AI-Summit-Presentation-Design-Session.md`](2025-10-06-AI-Summit-Presentation-Design-Session.md) | Structured session log created using the Session Synthesizer; integrates narrative and visual threads. | Session Synthesis |
| [`2025-10-07-AI-Summit-Presentation-Conclusion-Design.md`](2025-10-07-AI-Summit-Presentation-Conclusion-Design.md) | Final reflective session on moral framing and closing structure. | Session Synthesis |

### 🧠 Why It Matters

Most organizations discard the *process data* behind their work — meeting notes, drafts, transcripts, AI interactions.  
Here, those artifacts are preserved as **evidence of reasoning**, allowing future teams to study and reuse the patterns behind innovation.

Capturing this provenance:
- Documents the **origin and sponsorship of ideas**.  
- Shows how AI contributions were guided and interpreted by humans.  
- Builds an **institutional memory system** that learns from itself.

### 🪶 Guiding Principle
> *“Provenance isn’t about hierarchy or form — it’s about preserving the conversation that created the idea.”*
