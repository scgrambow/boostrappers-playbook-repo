# Process Provenance

This folder documents the **working record** behind your AI-assisted projects — the "science flight recorder" of *The Bootstrapper’s Playbook.*

Each file captures how a piece of work was created: the prompts, iterations, insights, and decisions that shaped it.  
Together, these records show not only **what** was built, but **how** it came to be.

### 🧭 Purpose

Process Provenance turns invisible thinking into visible knowledge.

By logging your sessions, tools, and reflections, you create a living audit trail that supports:

- **Transparency** – others can see how ideas evolved.  
- **Reproducibility** – methods and reasoning can be retraced.  
- **Learning** – patterns in your own creative and analytical process become data for improvement.

### 🧩 What to Record

Each provenance entry should be concise but structured.  
Think of it as a *snapshot* of a working session rather than a full transcript.

| Component | Description | Example File |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Session Synthesis** | Summary of an AI session: goal, process, and outcome. | [`2025-10-01_AI_Summit_Session_Synthesis.md`](2025-10-01_AI_Summit_Session_Synthesis.md) |
| **Tool Use Record** | Example of a specific tool in action (e.g., Session Synthesizer). | [`tools_used.md`](tools_used.md) |
| **Reflection Note** | Quick reflection or insight gained from the work. | [`2025-10-07_Presentation_Reflection.md`](2025-10-07_Presentation_Reflection.md) |

You can adapt these to fit your own workflow — what matters most is *capturing reasoning at the moment it happens.*

### ⚙️ How to Create a Provenance Entry

1. **Start with intent** – one sentence: “What was I trying to accomplish?”  
2. **Capture the structure** – what tools, prompts, or personas were active?  
3. **Summarize the outcome** – what was produced or learned?  
4. **Tag and store** – save as a dated `.md` file using this format:  

    `YYYY-MM-DD_Brief_Descriptive_Title.md`

5. **Link it back** – connect the provenance file to the relevant template, persona, or output.

### 🧠 Example Use Case

> During development of the *Bootstrapper’s Playbook* presentation, each working session was logged here — from narrative design to prototype testing.  
> These notes later became the backbone for the **Executive Brief** and the “Anatomy of an Answer” demo.

### 🪶 Guiding Principle
> *“Science advances when we remember how we built the last experiment.”*

Process Provenance ensures that every AI-assisted idea, experiment, or workflow carries its own origin story — a transparent lineage of reasoning that others can trace, learn from, and build upon.
