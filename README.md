# Bootstrappers Playbook

A transparent, reproducible framework for building your own **Portable AI Brain** ‚Äî blending human creativity and structured AI collaboration. This repository models **Process Provenance**: the ability to document how ideas, tools, and AI collaborators contribute to the evolution of a project.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

This repository serves as both an example and a toolkit for:
- Designing reproducible AI-assisted workflows.
- Maintaining transparency about the origin and evolution of ideas.
- Demonstrating responsible human‚ÄìAI collaboration.

The **Bootstrappers Playbook** was originally developed for the *Duke AI Summit 2025: AI for Health Innovation*, and includes the materials, templates, and provenance files that supported the presentation.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### `/templates/`
This folder includes all reusable templates that form the foundation of the Playbook. Each template is modular and can be adapted to your own workflow.

#### Included Templates
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **01_Lean_Master_Prompt_Template.md** | A concise starting point for defining any AI-assisted workflow. |
| **02_Universal_Knowledge_Template.md** | Framework for structuring reusable knowledge and references across projects. |
| **03_Project_Specific_Knowledge_Template.md** | Template for managing domain- or project-specific knowledge in a transparent way. |
| **04_Standalone_Tool_Session_Synthesizer.md** | A standalone tool that captures structured session data ‚Äî documenting human‚ÄìAI collaboration in both narrative and machine-readable formats. |

#### `/templates/personas/`
This subfolder contains reusable **AI collaborator personas** that represent distinct cognitive roles in your workflow.

| Persona | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Thinking_Partner.md** | A reflective collaborator focused on pattern recognition, insight reframing, and conceptual clarity. |
| **Audacious_Muse.md** | A bold ideation catalyst that surfaces hidden insights and inspires creative reframing. |

These personas can be referenced directly from the Universal Knowledge Template or activated within any prompt or project manifest.

---

### `/process-provenance/`
This folder provides an **illustrative sample of provenance documentation**, showing how the presentation and website were designed through iterative human‚ÄìAI collaboration.

Each file captures a different phase of the creative process ‚Äî from early narrative structuring to visual design refinement ‚Äî using the same synthesis principles embedded in the Session Synthesizer tool.

#### Representative Examples
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **2025-10-05-Presentation_Narrative_Structure.md** | Outlines the conceptual backbone of the talk. |
| **2025-10-06-AI_Summit_Presentation_Design_Session.md** | Captures iterative AI-assisted design planning for the slides. |
| **2025-10-06-Proposed_Visual_Arc.md** | Describes the intended visual storytelling arc. |
| **2025-10-07-AI_Summit_Presentation_Conclusion_Design.md** | Documents the framing of the final synthesis slides. |

These examples illustrate how documentation can serve both creative reflection and process transparency.

### `/site/`
Contains the public-facing **index.html** and **favicon.png** files for the Bootstrappers Playbook website. This version is hosted via Netlify and serves as the companion resource for the Duke AI Summit 2025 presentation.

## üß© Key Concepts

- **Process Provenance** ‚Äì The traceable documentation of how ideas, prompts, personas, and tools shape an evolving project.  
- **Portable AI Brain** ‚Äì A modular, reproducible configuration of prompts, templates, and personas that travels with you across contexts.  
- **Flight Recorder** ‚Äì A transparency mechanism for capturing representative examples of your process in real time, without overburdening the workflow.
