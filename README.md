This directory contains the three core Markdown templates for building your own **"Portable AI Brain."** These are designed to be copied, customized, and used on any AI chat platform.

## How to Get Started (Your "Crawl" Stage)
Ready to begin your journey? Start here — this is your “Crawl” stage in action:

1. **Fork or Download this Repository:** Get a copy of these files for your own use.

2. **Customize Your Universal Knowledge file:** Open `02_Universal_Knowledge_Template.md` to define your core principles and trusted personas.”. This is the most important step in personalizing your AI assistant.

3. **Run Your First Session:** The next time you have a complex task, use `01_Lean_Master_Prompt_Template.md` and `03_Project_Specific_Knowledge_Template.md` to structure your context. Test it with a real problem you’re facing.
    
4. **Combine and Collaborate:** Paste the contents of all three files into the chatbot of your choice to create and collaborate with your own expert assistant. This simple three-file fusion is your first ‘Portable AI Brain.’
