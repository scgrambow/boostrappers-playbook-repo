# Persona Library

This folder contains reusable **AI collaborator personas** — modular identity profiles that define how your AI operates within your personal or organizational "Portable AI Brain."

Each persona represents a **distinct cognitive role** designed to strengthen specific phases of creative or analytical work. Personas act as *reliable mental models* that make interactions reproducible, transparent, and tailored to your workflow.

### 🧠 Purpose

Personas transform AI from a reactive assistant into a structured collaborator.  
They provide **contextual identity**, guiding tone, focus, and reasoning style.

Use them to:
- Maintain **consistency** across projects and sessions.  
- Encode your **preferred working styles** (e.g., reflective, analytical, visionary).  
- Support **Process Provenance** by making cognitive intent explicit.
