# Template Library

This folder contains the **core templates** that form the foundation of your *Portable AI Brain*.  
Each template represents a reusable building block in the *Bootstrapper’s Playbook* system — designed to make AI work transparent, modular, and reproducible.

### 🧭 Purpose

Templates are the **starting points** for structured AI collaboration.  
They define *how* you work, document *what* you build, and make your process visible for others to learn from.

Each template helps capture a different layer of your AI operating system:

| Layer | Purpose | Example Files |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Mission Layer** | Defines your intent, role, and context. | [`01_Lean_Master_Prompt_Template.md`](01_Lean_Master_Prompt_Template.md) |
| **Operating System Layer** | Holds your reusable libraries of principles, personas, and tools. | [`02_Universal_Knowledge_Template.md`](02_Universal_Knowledge_Template.md) |
| **Briefing Layer** | Manages project-specific data, files, and transient context. | [`03_Project_Specific_Knowledge_Template.md`](03_Project_Specific_Knowledge_Template.md) |
| **Tool Layer** | Encapsulates reusable functions or assistants that extend your workflow. | [`04_Standalone_Tool_Session_Synthesizer.md`](04_Standalone_Tool_Session_Synthesizer.md) |

### 🧩 Personas

Personas live inside the `/personas/` subfolder.  
They are **modular collaborator templates** that define distinct cognitive roles for AI-assisted work — for example, reflective analysis or creative reframing.

| Persona | Description | Location |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Thinking Partner** | Reflective collaborator focused on pattern detection, insight reframing, and constructive amplification. | [personas/Thinking_Partner.md](personas/Thinking_Partner.md) |
| **Audacious Muse** | Bold ideation catalyst that surfaces hidden insights and reframes problems creatively. | [personas/Audacious_Muse.md](personas/Audacious_Muse.md) |

### ⚙️ How to Use These Templates

1. **Clone or copy** any of the templates into your own workspace.  
2. **Customize** the variables, role definitions, or prompts to match your goals.  
3. **Track your edits** in `/process-provenance/` to document how your system evolves over time.  
4. **Build your own library** — each new prompt, tool, or persona you create can be saved here for reuse.

### 🪶 Guiding Principle
> *“A template is not a form to fill out — it’s a scaffold for clarity.”*

Each file in this directory represents a living artifact of structured thinking — one you can reuse, remix, and trace as part of your evolving Process Provenance.
